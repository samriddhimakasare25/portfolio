    ## Challenge
    When traveling, especially in a foreign country, it’s often overwhelming to find the best places to visit. You can get lost in an endless sea of blogs, travel guides, and review sites, each with conflicting information. I’ve experienced this frustration firsthand while traveling. Finding a reliable and consolidated source of information felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.
    
    According to a recent travel survey, over 65% of tourists say they struggle to find reliable information on local attractions and restaurants when traveling. 40% of travelers waste nearly 2 hours per day searching for places to visit or eat, which takes away valuable time they could spend enjoying their trip.
    
    This inspired me to create SM-Travel, an app that simplifies the travel experience. I wanted it to become a one-stop solution for discovering hotels, restaurants, and attractions, all in one place. My goal was to provide real-time, accurate information and an interactive map to help users find and navigate these places effortlessly.
