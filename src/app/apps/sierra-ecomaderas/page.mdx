## Solution

<AppSolution href={appData.url}>
Our proposed solution for the HawkShop is a personalized instrument case designed specifically for music students. This product enhances the standard instrument case by allowing students to customize their cases with unique designs, names, or Laurier-themed patterns, offering both functionality and personal expression. The branding for this product focuses on creativity, individuality, and school pride, aligning with the HawkShop's current mix of school-branded merchandise and practical student essentials. Personalization will increase demand by appealing to students who want to stand out while protecting their instruments in style. This solution is feasible with minimal modification to the existing supply chain, leveraging partnerships with local printing and manufacturing services. Additionally, it fits well with the HawkShop’s mission to support students with practical and engaging products that enhance their experience at Laurier.

For our pitch, we presented our idea as a short play, creatively demonstrating how a student’s journey at Laurier could be enriched with this personalized instrument case. We highlighted scenarios where the case becomes a conversation starter and symbol of pride, reinforcing its value and connection to the university community.
