    ## Challenge

    At Hack the North 2024, I participated in the Ubisoft Game Development Challenge, where the goal was to design and develop a game within 36 hours based on a surprise theme revealed at the event.
    
    We had full creative freedom to use any engine, framework, or library to bring our ideas to life. The challenge pushed us to think fast, be innovative, and create a polished game experience under tight time constraints.
    
    The judging criteria focused on:

    1. Creativity: How unique and engaging the concept was.
    2. Gameplay: The overall user experience, mechanics, and fun factor.
    3. Adherence to the Theme: How well the game aligned with the surprise theme.

## Solution

<AppSolution image='realtor-simplified.png' href={appData.url}>
  
The Problem:
When our team went to Hack the North, we were super excited to catch some of the iconic goose merch handed out at the opening ceremony. We sat in what we thought was the best spot to catch the flying geese—right in the front row of the second floor. Unfortunately, every goose launched towards our section either missed or fell down, leaving us empty-handed. Disappointed but inspired, we decided to turn that moment into something fun.

The Solution:
We created Geese Love Merch, a game based on our experience at Hack the North. The game takes place in Lazarus Hall (where it all happened!) and stars an awesome goose on wheels as the main character. The goal of the game is simple: fire merch at sponsors who randomly pop up in the audience every 6 seconds. For each sponsor you hit, you score points and get closer to winning the ultimate prize—a dream internship!

How It Works:
Main Character: The goose on wheels with a merch cannon.
Gameplay: Shoot merch at sponsors that randomly appear in different seats.
Timing: Sponsors show up every 6 seconds, keeping the game fast and challenging.
Objective: Hit as many sponsors as possible and rack up points to win.
How We Built It:
We had little to no experience with Unity and C#, but we decided to take on the challenge and learn on the spot. We used Blender to create our 3D models, added animations and sound effects, and gave the game a fun, lively atmosphere. Tools like the Unity Asset Store helped us speed things up, and we used VSCode and GitHub to collaborate.

Challenges We Faced:
Learning Unity & C# in a Day: We had to teach ourselves how to use Unity and C# within 36 hours.
Collaboration Problems: Unity projects can be tricky to work on as a team—pushing changes at the same time caused crashes, which slowed us down.
Idea Overload: We had around 4–5 different ideas before finally committing to Geese Love Merch.
